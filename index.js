Okay, here's yet ANOTHER one!  Before, it seemed like
'escape characters' for when quotes are involved...was 
a big headache.  (Had to remember all the special 
syntax and it wasn't encountered / used very often.)
In JavaScript, turns out ALL YOU HAVE TO DO is
insert a backslash BEFORE the character you want to 
escape!!! */

// it gave me back a console.log of the method!!!

// console.log(myString.toUpperCase());
// Magic...put in the parens as required and it works 
// properly!
